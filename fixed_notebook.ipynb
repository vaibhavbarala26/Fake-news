[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Since then, he s received an earful from the former Prime Minister of Sweden, prompted questions from confused Swedes, and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack, too.One would have expected Trump to respond fairly quickly, since he s now formally joined the ranks of Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks, but he didn t. He waited until this afternoon to respond, and it s extremely laughable:My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017Yes, sure, by all means, let s call this debacle Fox News  fault and completely ignore the words that actually spewed forth from his mouth: You look at what s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers. They re having problems that they never thought possible. Twitter, meanwhile, is positively gleeful in their mockery of the liar of liars for another egregious lie:@realDonaldTrump  none of which referred to anything that happened two nights ago.  Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 19, 2017.@realDonaldTrump  I apologize. I will hold myself to provide a more clear and accurate respresentation of my beliefs in future speeches.  Will McAvoy (@WillMcAvoyACN) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Hey, dumbass. What happened in Sweden? Nothing. That s what. FAKE NEWS! pic.twitter.com/PR4Cu42mbb  The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Of course it fucking was.  Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump You said  last night in Sweden . Don t retract. You are fake news for the unintelligent.

Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews OK time to have a chat again, so tell President Emperor Bannon you need a smoke break. This will take a bit.  Kevin (@TheKevinDent) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you blindly spout whether @FoxNews tells you to? It s pathetic, not to mention awfully irresponsible, 45.  Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) February 19, 2017Here s what someone who appears to be in Sweden has to say:@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There is no migrant crisis in Sweden. We have free health care, free education, a functioning welfare system. ??  Ines Helene (@inihelene) February 19, 2017How embarrassing. You re hopelessly confused. Sad! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/2mRZAjuj6f  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 19, 2017Um @erichmcelroy is @realDonaldTrump now trying to blame @FoxNews? I thought we could trust them!  Mark Machado (@MarkMachado) February 19, 2017 Maybe, just as a change of pace and maybe to keep all of us on our toes, he should actually take responsibility for what he says and apologize. But what are we talking about?

Since then, he s received an earful from the former Prime Minister of Sweden, prompted questions from confused Swedes, and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack, too.One would have expected Trump to respond fairly quickly, since he s now formally joined the ranks of Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks, but he didn t. He waited until this afternoon to respond, and it s extremely laughable:My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017Yes, sure, by all means, let s call this debacle Fox News  fault and completely ignore the words that actually spewed forth from his mouth: You look at what s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers. They re having problems that they never thought possible. Twitter, meanwhile, is positively gleeful in their mockery of the liar of liars for another egregious lie:@realDonaldTrump  none of which referred to anything that happened two nights ago.  Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 19, 2017.@realDonaldTrump  I apologize. I will hold myself to provide a more clear and accurate respresentation of my beliefs in future speeches.  Will McAvoy (@WillMcAvoyACN) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Hey, dumbass. What happened in Sweden? Nothing. That s what. FAKE NEWS! pic.twitter.com/PR4Cu42mbb  The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Of course it fucking was.  Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump You said  last night in Sweden . Don t retract. You are fake news for the unintelligent.  Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 19, 2017You are fake news, Mr. So-Called President.#swedenincident #iamamuslimtoo #FuckYouBitch https://t.co/MGOL0oWFPs  Jade Helm Commander (@Anomaly100) February 19, 2017.@realDonaldTrump Who needs the intelligence community when there is Fox News?  Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) February 19, 2017Here s someone who was a likely witness to the imaginary attack, since reports say Swedish fish were everywhere at the scene:@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/bGk4nMmc5e  Mike Denison (@mikd33) February 19, 2017@mikd33 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews These fish are clearly terrorists.

Evan Dashevsky (@haldash) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump  oh I saw it on TV, people told me this  instead of being responsible for what comes out of his mouth.  Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews OK time to have a chat again, so tell President Emperor Bannon you need a smoke break. This will take a bit.  Kevin (@TheKevinDent) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you blindly spout whether @FoxNews tells you to? It s pathetic, not to mention awfully irresponsible, 45.  Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) February 19, 2017Here s what someone who appears to be in Sweden has to say:@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There is no migrant crisis in Sweden. We have free health care, free education, a functioning welfare system. ??  Ines Helene (@inihelene) February 19, 2017How embarrassing. You re hopelessly confused. Sad! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/2mRZAjuj6f  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 19, 2017Um @erichmcelroy is @realDonaldTrump now trying to blame @FoxNews? I thought we could trust them!  Mark Machado (@MarkMachado) February 19, 2017 Maybe, just as a change of pace and maybe to keep all of us on our toes, he should actually take responsibility for what he says and apologize. But what are we talking about? Trump is one of the worst pathological liars in the long, sad history of pathological liars.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images\",\n          \"TweetwaveThis time it's true no pantsTweetwave More Of Anthony Weiner's Greatest Hits Users browsing this forum: No registered users and 13 guests Display posts from previous: Powered by phpBB \\u00a9 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007 phpBB Group The uncontested absurdities of today are the accepted slogans of tomorrow.

still includes an offense called precriminal social dangerousness which is punishable by up to four years in prisonthe country is unlikely to see an improvement in respect for fundamental civil and

Like the first suspension last month , this time also the reason is significant number of passengers from India testing positive on arrival in Hong Kong.\\u201cHong Kong civil aviation authority has advised AI not to operate for two weeks from till October 3. Only one flight was scheduled to operate in this period \\u2014 Delhi-Hong Kong on Monday (September 21) which has been cancelled and passengers informed,\\u201d said a senior AI official.Last month also Hong Kong had barred Air India flights for two weeks after 11 passengers who flew in there from Delhi on August 14 had tested positive on arrival. Cathay Pacific is not operating to India during the pandemic.Chinese media reports Hong Kong has temporarily suspended Cathay Dragon (Cathay\\u2019s regional arm) flights on Kuala Lumpur route. Five people flew AI Express to Malaysia and then took a connecting flight to Hong Kong, where they tested positive on arrival, according to those reports.Last week Dubai aviation authorities had decided to suspend AI Express operations to the city for 15 days after the budget airline twice flew passengers with Covid positive reports there from India. Following an apology from AI Express and assurance that the same will not happen again, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority revoked this suspension.Last Friday, the airline\\u2019s spokesperson had said: \\u201cWe have apologised for the two lapses to Dubai authorities and assured them of putting in place multi-level strict checks to ensure the same does not get repeated. (Accordingly) all AI Express flights from and to Dubai will operate as per original schedule from Saturday (September 19).\\u201d\",\n          \"An edited image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowing in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping with folded hands is being shared on social media.

A clarification was later issued by the Prime Minister's Office about 'the mischievous interpretation of PM's statement.'\\n\\n\\n\\nFact check\\n\\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the photograph and found this PTI photo taken during Modi and Xi Jinping's 2019 meeting at Mamallapuram.

The article reported that the prime minister had visited Tumkur to inaugurate the India Food Park.\\n\\nThe same image was fact-checked by BOOM Hindi earlier.

operate in this period delhihong kong on monday september 21 which has been cancelled and passengers informed said a senior ai officiallast month also hong kong had barred air india flights for two

inc rahul gandhi addressing a rally in delhi ahead of the assembly elections is doing the rounds on twitter with claims that he delivered a bizarre and comic speech in the first part of the edited footage gandhi throws a question to the audiences and asks them the reason why eagles are flying above as he speaks he points at the sky a short clip of birds flying can be seen immediately after in the second part of the footage he refers to prime minister narendra modi rashtriya swayam sevak rss and the bharatiya janata party bjp and how they are responsible for unemployment both the clips have been mischievously joined and the sequence altered in a way that it appears that gandhi blamed the bjp government for the lack of employment among the birds the edited footage has been tweeted by harsh sanghavi the national vice president of bjp yuva morcha who took a dig at gandhi for drawing such bizarre comparisons sanghavi wrote someone at least stop him the same footage has been doing the rounds on whatsapp and facebook it has been viewed more than 12 million times on facebook at the time of writing this article the video has been captioned as pappus comedy show it has been doing the rounds with a hindi caption which translates to english as why are these eagles flying here because they are not getting employment and narendra modi and rss are responsible for this rahul gandhi original text in hindi rss boom received it on its helpline number for verification as well fact check boom could ascertain that the video has been created for comic purposes and gandhi did not draw comparison between flying eagles and unemployment a logo of being baklol can be seen on the bottom left being baklol is a satirical group which produces comic content upon relevant keyword searches we found the same speech where gandhi was addressing an election campaign in kondli new delhi on february 5 parts of the speech had been tampered with sequence changed and joined to produce the viral clip rahul gandhi begins his speech and says how the countrys harmony has been disrupted in the past five years he can be seen interacting with 10 year old kids who approve of the same he then asks what could be the reason behind the disruption reference of eagles flying above at 9 minute 45 seconds gandhi makes the eagle reference and compares how commoners have to face poor living conditions while pm modi gives tax benefits to the rich of the country he says ok brother tell my what are the eagles doing here why are they flying here can anybody say why the eagles are flying here how many crores will be needed to remove this dirt narendra modi ji had waved off rs 130000 crores taxes for the richest men of india you people stay in dirt for 24 7 and the rich can live at peace in castles lack of unemployment for last five years in his address rahul gandhi then goes on to stress on how the youth has been confused he says they have been studying for so many years they went to school college and university and also took exams but for the past five years they have not been earning anything and when the youth of any country doesnt see a road ahead then they are angered at 3 minute 30 second mark the context of how a situation of lack of income has been created for the youth is referred to the same part has been used at the 20 second mark in the viral video narendra modi bjp and rss reference at 3 minute 15 seconds gandhi can be heard saying what is the reason behind this a lot of people will say that the reason is narendra modi the reason is rss and the reason is bjp but i will want to look at it differently the biggest reason is that the youth of the country doesnt have any aim they are afraid of unemployment the exact narendra modi bjp and rss reference was edited and inserted in the viral comic clip at 24 second mark below is the facebook live video from the same day also read false aap mla amanatullah khan said we will become sharia\"\n        ],\n
